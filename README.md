# PickUp
## Welcome to PickUp!
Pickup is an app in development that allows a user to setup and view other pickup games in the area. Currently, the app only works in Austin but ideally will work depending on the users location. The app is developed with React, Redux, runs on a Node.js server, and stores data in a MongoDB database.
